# Robotics Notebook

This is the Obsidian notebook I have been using to take notes on the research I am interested in and the research that I am leading. 

## *The Whole Enchilada*

In this repository, I'd like to create a map of robotics. This will give everyone guidance on how to access the subdirectories in this notebook.

Robotics is a large, interdisciplinary field that can be quite a lot to grasp. Creating a connectivity map of the field is nearly impossible without some basis (angle) to ground the map, such as application domains like "humanoids" or "autonomous vehicles." Some works have used core components to divide give grounding to the map, such as perception, control, planning, and embedded systems. 

Despite that, I will try to do so in this notebook.

Lets try to take an angle from a Search and Rescue challenge: design a robot to search for and find objects and/or persons.
